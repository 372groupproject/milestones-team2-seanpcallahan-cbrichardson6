for Unix:
  - nagigate to the directory with the file
  - check that you have the gfortran compiler program available by typing gfortran --version
  - on the command line call 'f95 -o hello_world hello_world.f95' to compile it
  - run the program with ./hello_world
 
 for Windows
  - nagigate to the directory with the file
  - check that you have the gfortran compiler program available by typing gfortran --version
  - compile the program with 'f95 hello_world.f90 -o hello_world.exe'
  - run it
