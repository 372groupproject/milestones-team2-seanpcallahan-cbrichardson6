- theme is you are stuck in a server room that is on fire and the only way out is through writing a fortran script to open the door

- ideas to convey is what is the language, why is it "dead", and what languages did it influence

- code sample will be a rough script that somehow looks like it would open a door while conveniently showing all fortran 95 features

- we will demo a running of it in a video

- we will be planning on just doing slides but if Misurda decides to not kill us slowly with horrible projects we might be a little
  more frisky
